# atm-database
Ended up adding more features to a class assignment--most notably a simple database which stores user-inputted data which can be accessed and modified within the program.

Code is written and executed in [app.py](atm_database/app.py) with some additional functions written in [accounts.py](atm_database/banking_pkg/accounts.py)
